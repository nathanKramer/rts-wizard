#### Elements
These are the plain old element icons, they should inform the other icon types directly
Some things to consider:
- Each icon should be easily recognisable
- All eight icons should resolve to an aesthetically pleasing colour palette
- Icons should be relevant to the element being expressed
- The current icons are 45x44, this is only because the MWW icons were like that
  - Consider 48x48 or 64x64?
